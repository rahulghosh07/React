previously when we added the key to each item of items we forgot to add className to each items by doing that we will be successfull 
to click each item or identify each items .and then we can th onClick property by
onClick={()=>console.log('Clicked')} by doinig this , every time a item is clicked clicked will be printed in the console.
Also we can see which item we are clicking on and index of that item 
by writing onClick={()=>console.log(item,index)}
Also this onClick event can be identified if wwe do onClick={(event)=>console.log(event)}
This will show which evenet we are performiing.

But for more complex operations, if we want to create a function where we done all the operations and pass it to items.map
then we can write const handleClick= (event) => console.log(event)but as here event is 
implecit we have to do const handleClick= (event:MouseEvent) => console.log(event) and import {MouseEvent} from "react";
const handleClick= (event:MouseEvent) => console.log(event.bubbles)
