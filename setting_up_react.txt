To create a react app-
    there are two ways -
        1. Create React App(CRA)
        2. Vite


 To create a new react app using vite-
    We have to open cmd prompt and write npm create vite@latest
                                         then y
                                         then project name
                                         then select a framwork
                                         then select the language
                                         it will create a folder of your choosen place and choosen name.
                                         now you have to go that specific folder and for that
                                         you have to write cd project name 
                                         then npm install
                                         then code . and it will open the vs code 

and after working sonmething on the react app if we closed that for that day and to gain up to date for the start of the next day
just type npm run dev in the terminal OR we can always first install npm by npm install then npm start and npm run dev by doing this it will create a page in the local host .
