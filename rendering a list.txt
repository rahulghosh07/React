To render a list dynamically-
    we can create a list of items
    and to travesre each item we can't ise for loop as jsx does not have any for loop.
    So we have to use the map() method.

like this-
cont items=['New York', 'San Fransisco', 'Delhi', 'Kolkata'];
items.map(item=>(
    <li>{item}</li>
)) 

as we know inside a jsx file we can write either html or react components
so to pass render this we have to wrap it up inside {}.

After doing this wraping ,if we look into the console by inspecting we will see there is a warning 
that shows that each child in a list should have a unique "key' prop.i.e. while rendering th list items 
we should give unique keys to each items to keep track of them for later modyfying purpose.
