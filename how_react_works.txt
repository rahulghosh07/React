here app is the root component or parent and message is a child, this is a component tree.
React takes it as a component tree and convert it into a js data structure known as virtual dom.
If we update any data then the corresponding node gets updated then react compare that node with previous one and that's how react works
Tchnically this updation is done by react companion library called ReactDom.

Generally if we look in th index.html file we can see that whole container is under root id and we can see that the script file main.tsx 
is added to it and the main.tsx file we can see that ReactDom is rendering the root id by dom manipulation i.e. getElemnetById

So here by we are creating a component tree where the parent component is app and it has various child component 
this component tree known as <App/> is under a built in component known as React.StrictMOde which does 
not have any visual representation but it's purpose is to identify potential problems.
And then rendering it whol inside the id root and to do that we are using ReactDom library.
We can render this component tree in a mobile app using ReactNative.
