React is a javascript library which is used to build dynamic and interactive web pages or user interfaces.
It was created by facebook in 2011.
The thinh is while using vanilla javascript the web page is built using a tree structure and it builds on basis of DOM.
in vanilla javascript the handling of DOM becomes quite difficult in case of big web pages that's where
react comes in. In case of react we no longer need to worry about querying and updating DOM
elements instaed we describe an web page using small and reusable components.
And that's how react takes care of efficiently creating and pdating DOM elements.


Mainly in case of react components help us to write reusable, modular and better organized code.

Before react was only a client side rendering library meaning it was used only for the frontend part.
But now it got merged with next js which is a framework so now it can work as both client side and server side rendering.

Node js is the run time environment for javascript.
