first we have to install bootstrap and to do that
we have to type npm i bootstrap@5.2.3 OR npm i bootstrap

As our app is created by vite there will be styles in the css files , we don't need any of that any more so we will
delete all the content inside that css files.

To import the bootstrap in our app, inside the main.tsx file as a repalcement of the css import line
we have to write import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'

By convention we should always create a components folder inside src folder and inside that folder we have to create 
a file named ListGroup.tsx
and then write the code to create some list components OR copy it from bootstrap.

inside a return(); we can't return more than one components(like returning something using<h1></h1> along with <ul></ul>)
as a solve of that we have to return all this componnets inside a div.
OR we can wrap this elements using fragment by typing----- import { Fragment } from "react";
OR we can just wrap those component inside an empty tag <></> by doing this we are using fragment but withi=ou importing it.
