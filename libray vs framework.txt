React is a javascript library for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.

React is a library where as angular, vue are frameworks.

library is a tool provides specific functionality.
frameworks are set of tools and guidelines for building apps.

we can say that library is a like a tool(pen,pencil,eraser).
where as a framework is a tool set(like a pencil box which contains all the libraries).
framework is super set of libraries.
Generally we don't only uses react as it does the designing part, we use other comonents to does routing(which means going from one page to another),
HTTP,Managing the application state, Internationalization, Form validation, Animations etc.

And as for advanatages of react it does not specify any tool to work with so we can pick the right tool for the job.
