suppose the list of the items we are rendering is empty the we can always 
if(items.length==0)
    return <p>No item found</p>

we are doing this separately from the previous operation, and because of that we have to repeat some code and we don't want to that
and we also can't write if satement inside return() as it's jss code and that's why 
we will write{items.length==0?<p>Item not found</p>:null}
or we can create const getMessage=()=>{
    items.length==0? <p>Item not found</p>:null;
}
